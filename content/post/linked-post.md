## IoT and software

online platforms are offering services to connect low cost electronics to the cloud. From the educational point of view, this favors the sharing of results and data with others. Most platforms run on opensource software, though it is necessary to create an account, which is a barrier in the school context, though they often offer interconnectivity with other provider.

### Arduino 

Arduino's platform is interesting as you would always use up to date software and all libraries are already preloaded, and projects ready to upload. In the school context, it is at the moment  complicated due to a needed plugin in the browser.

The under assessment solution in school is to use the portable version.

### Thingspeak

Thingspeak is powerful and easy to use, providing we have some ways of connecting to the internet with our electronics. In the school context, the option seems to be Raspberry pi, using the school wifi.

### Blynk

Blynk needs a mobile phone to be used and is being currently assesed

### Github

or Bitbucket, ...

This repositories are a useful way to work and share fast for any serious robotics enthusiast. Arduino libraries, and plenty of opensource projects and sofwares, are hosted here in some ways.

### Adafruit

As of December 2019, Adafruit platform is live and is being currently tested, aimed at makers though no easy account creation
